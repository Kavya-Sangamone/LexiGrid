let us take row-0 col-0 direction-across canplace(optics,0,0,across,false)
r=0
c=0
existing[0][0]="" hence can_place is true;

find_best_location=(0,0,across)
[0,0] to [0,10] -ultraviolet placed.
placed=[ultraviolet]

2)WAVELENGTH
ode: for existing_word, erow, ecol, edir, _, _ in placed_words_shuffled:
Action: Pick the first (and only, for this example) tuple from placed_words_shuffled.
Values:
existing_word = "ULTRAVIOLET"
erow = 5
ecol = 3
edir = "across"
_, _ (ignored): clue_number, clue
Progress: Move to the next loop, focusing on "ULTRAVIOLET".


Step 2: Second Loop â€“ Iterate Over Letters in existing_word
Code: for i, char in enumerate(existing_word):
Action: Loop through each letter in "ULTRAVIOLET", getting its index i and character char.
Letters:
i=0, char="U"
i=1, char="L"
i=2, char="T"
i=3, char="R"
i=4, char="A"
i=5, char="V"
i=6, char="I"
i=7, char="O"
i=8, char="L"
i=9, char="E"
i=10, char="T"
Progress: For each char, proceed to the next loop.


Check for Matching Letters
Code: if letter == char:
Action: If the current letter in "WAVELENGTH" matches the current letter in "ULTRAVIOLET", proceed to compute a potential intersection.
Common Letters:
"ULTRAVIOLET": U, L, T, R, A, V, I, O, L, E, T
"WAVELENGTH": W, A, V, E, L, E, N, G, T, H
Matches: A, V, E, L, T (noting duplicates: L appears twice in "ULTRAVIOLET", E appears twice in "WAVELENGTH", T appears twice in "ULTRAVIOLET", once in "WAVELENGTH").
Progress: For each match, compute the intersection position and try placing the word.


if start_row >= 0 and start_col >= 0:
                                if can_place(word, start_row, start_col, new_dir):
                                    return start_row, start_col, new_dir
it came negative start_row and start_col

word-temparature matched with  U letter in both failed at  if start_row >= 0 and start_col >= 0:  then matched with t placed at [0,2,down] 
next word is equilibrium  

first -line 121 then U is matched with ultraviot and equilibrium .but startrow is -2
